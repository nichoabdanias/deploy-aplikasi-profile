As a student and web developer, I have a strong desire to learn
              and grow in both fields. I'm dedicated to balancing my academic
              duties with skill development as a web developer. With knowledge
              and skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I can design and develop
              attractive and responsive websites. I use my free time to learn
              about the latest trends in web development and apply them in
              personal projects. My goal is to continue to expand my knowledge
              as a student and develop a strong portfolio as a web developer.
